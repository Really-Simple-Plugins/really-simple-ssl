Easily improve site security with WordPress hardening, vulnerability detection and SSL certificate generation.

== Description ==

=== Really simple, effective and lightweight WordPress Security ===
Really Simple SSL is the most lightweight and easy-to-use security plugin for WordPress. It lays the foundation of your WordPress website's security by leveraging your SSL certificate, scanning for possible vulnerabilities and implementing essential WordPress hardening features.

We believe that security should have the absolute minimum effect on website performance, user experience and maintainability. Therefore, Really Simple SSL is:

* **Lightweight:** Every security feature is developed with a modular approach and with performance in mind. Disabled features won't load any redundant code.
* **Easy-to-use:** 1-minute configuration with short onboarding setup.

=== Security Features ===

= Easy SSL Migration =
Migrates your website to HTTPS and enforces SSL in just one click.

* 301 redirect via PHP or .htaccess
* Secure cookies
* Let's Encrypt: Install an SSL Certificate if your hosting provider supports manual installation.
* Server Health Check: Your server configuration is every bit as important for your website security.

= WordPress Hardening =
Tweak your configuration and keep WordPress fortified and safe by tackling potential weaknesses.

* Prevent code execution in the uploads folder
* Prevent login feedback and disable user enumeration
* Disable XML-RPC
* Disable directory browsing
* Username restrictions (block 'admin' and public names)
* and much more..

= Vulnerability Detection =
Get notified when plugins, themes or WP core contain vulnerabilities and need appropriate action.

=== Improve Security with Really Simple SSL Pro ===
[Protect your site with all essential security features by upgrading to Really Simple SSL Pro.](https://really-simple-ssl.com/)

= Advanced SSL enforcement =
* Mixed Content Scan & Fixer. Detect files that are requested over HTTP and fix it, both Front- and Back-end.
* Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security and configure your site for the HSTS Preload list.

= Security Headers =
Security headers protect your site visitors against the risk of clickjacking, cross-site-forgery attacks, stealing login credentials and malware.

* Independent of your Server Configuration, works on Apache, LiteSpeed, NGINX, etc.
* Protect your website visitors with X-XSS Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, a Referrer Policy and CORS headers.
* Automatically generate your WordPress-tailored Content Security Policy.

= Vulnerability Measures =
When a vulnerability is detected in a plugin, theme or WordPress core you will get notified accordingly. With Vulnerability Measures, you can configure simple but effective measures to make sure that a critical vulnerability won't remain unattended.

* Force update: An update process will be tried multiple times until it can be assumed development of a theme or plugin is abandoned. You will be notified during these steps.
* Quarantine: When a plugin or theme can't be updated to solve a vulnerability, Really Simple SSL can quarantine the plugin.

= Advanced Site Hardening =
* Choose a custom login URL
* Automated File Permissions check and fixer
* Rename and randomize your database prefix
* Change the debug.log file location to a non-public folder
* Disable application passwords
* Control admin creation
* Disable HTTP methods, reducing HTTP requests

= Login Protection =
Secure your website's login process and user accounts with powerful security measures.

* Two-Step verification (Email login)
* Enforce strong passwords and frequent password change
* Limit Login Attempts

With Limit Login Attempts you can configure a threshold to temporarily or permanently block IP addresses or (non-existing) usernames. You can also throw a CAPTCHA after a failed login (hCaptcha or Google reCaptcha)

= Access Control =
* Restrict access to your site for specific regions.
* Add specific IP addresses or IP ranges to the Blocklist or Allowlist.

== About Really Simple Plugins ==
Our mission is to make complex WordPress requirements really easy. Really Simple SSL is developed by [Really Simple Plugins](https://www.really-simple-plugins.com).

For generating SSL certificates, Really Simple SSL uses the [le acme2 PHP](https://github.com/fbett/le-acme2-php/) Let's Encrypt client library, thanks to 'fbett' for providing it. Vulnerability Detection uses WP Vulnerability, an open-source initiative by Javier Casares. Want to join as a collaborator? We're on [GitHub](https://github.com/really-simple-plugins/really-simple-ssl) as well!

== Installation ==
To install this plugin:

1. Make a backup! See [our recommendations](https://really-simple-ssl.com/knowledge-base/backing-up-your-site/).
2. Download the plugin.
3. Upload the plugin to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
4. Go to "Plugins" in your WordPress admin, then click "Activate".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Knowledge Base =
For more detailed explanations and documentation on all Really Simple SSL features, please search the [Knowlegde Base](https://www.really-simple-ssl.com/knowledge-base/)

= Mixed Content issues =
Most mixed content issues are caused by URLs in CSS or JS files. For detailed instructions on how to find mixed content read this [article](https://really-simple-ssl.com/knowledge-base/how-to-track-down-mixed-content-or-insecure-content/).

= Generating a Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate =
We added the possibility to generate a Free SSL Certificate with Let's Encrypt in our Really Simple SSL Wizard. We have an updated list available for all possible integrations [here](https://really-simple-ssl.com/install-ssl-certificate/). Please leave feedback about another integration, incorrect information, or you need help.

= Redirect loop issues =
If you are experiencing redirect loops on your site, try these [instructions](https://really-simple-ssl.com/knowledge-base/my-website-is-in-a-redirect-loop/).

= Is the plugin multisite compatible? =
Yes. There is a dedicated network settings page where you can control settings for your entire network, at once.

= Uninstalling Really Simple SSL =
The plugin checks your certificate before enabling, but if, for example, you migrated the site to a non-SSL environment, you might get locked out of the back-end.

If you can't deactivate, do not just remove the plugin folder to uninstall! Follow these [instructions](https://really-simple-ssl.com/knowledge-base/uninstall-websitebackend-not-accessible/) instead.

== Upgrade notice ==
On settings page load, the .htaccess file is no rewritten. If you have made .htaccess customizations to the RSSSL block and have not blocked the plugin from editing it, do so before upgrading.
Always back up before any upgrade. Especially .htaccess, wp-config.php and the plugin folder. This way you can easily roll back.
